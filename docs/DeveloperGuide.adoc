By: `CS2113T-W12-4`      Since: `Jun 2016`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram_new.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

// tag::ui[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `InventoryListPanel`, `BatchListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `DrinkDetailPane` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

// end::ui[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.


[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram_new.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the InventoryList data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Drink>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the TransactionList data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Transaction>` that can be observed
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

// tag::storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram_new.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read them back.
* can save the `LoginInfo` objects in json format and read them back.
* can save the Inventory List data in xml format and read it back.
* can save the Transaction List data in xml format and read it back.

// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::analyses[]
=== Analyses of costs, revenue and profit in the company over periods of time
==== Implementation
To facilitate the analyses of total profit, revenue and costs of the company over various periods of time,
transactions (sales and purchases) are logged using `Transaction` s.
They will be logged when the drink stock increases due to a purchase (`TransactionType` is `PURCHASE`),
or when they decrease due to a sale (`TransactionType` is `SALE`).
These transactions are stored into a list of transactions, in `TransactionList`.

Analyses are conducted in `AnalysisManager`, with the API exposed in `Analysis`.
The following operations are implemented for the analyses of profit, revenue and costs:

* `Analysis#analyseCost(AnalysisPeriodType period)`
* `Analysis#analyseRevenue(AnalysisPeriodType period)`
* `Analysis#analyseProfit(AnalysisPeriodType period)`

The implementation of these operations are elaborated in the below sub-sections.

==== Indicating the analysis period with `AnalysisPeriodType`
`AnalysisPeriodType` is an enum class that denotes the period for analysis:

* in the current day
* within the past 7 days (including the current day)
* within the past 30 days (including the current day)

These are indicated respectively as:

* `AnalysisPeriodType.DAY`
* `AnalysisPeriodType.WEEK`
* `AnalysisPeriodType.MONTH`.

A user may enter an analysis command with additional time period parameters.
For the period of a day, no parameter is indicated.
For the period of 7 days, `-w` is appended to the command. (e.g. `costs -w`)
For the period of 30 days, `-m` is appended to the command. (e.g. `costs -m`)

The following is the sequence of steps when the user enters an analysis command with a time period:

*Step 1.* User enters an analysis command (e.g. `costs -m`).

*Step 2.* The appropriate parser (e.g. `AnalyseCostsCommandParser`) parses the time period parameter,
and retrieves the `AnalysisPeriodType` value corresponding to the time period.

*Step 3.* The relevant `TransactionPeriodPredicate` for the `AnalysisPeriodType` value is retrieved. It is assigned to an Analysis Command (e.g. `AnalyseCostsCommand`).

The available `TransactionPeriodPredicate` s corresponding to each `AnalysisPeriodType` are:

* `DAY`: `TransactionInADayPredicate`
* `WEEK`: `TransactionInSevenDaysPredicate`
* `MONTH`: `TransactionInThirtyDaysPredicate`

These are retrieved using `AnalysisPeriodType#getPeriodFilterPredicate()`.

*Step 4.* The analysis command is executed, and the `TransactionPeriodPredicate` predicate is passed to the appropriate `ModelManager`.
This is done through the `analyseCosts()` method in the appropriate `ModelManager`.

*Step 5.* In the appropriate `ModelManager` (Accountant or Manager), the predicate is passed to the filtered transaction list.
This is in order to filter the transactions by their dates such that
the filtered transaction list only contains transactions with dates within the relevant period.

`FilteredList<Transaction>` handles the filtering using the given predicate.


The following sequence diagram shows how the first part of the `AnalyseCostCommand` works, as described above:

image::AnalyseCostsSequenceDiagram_p1.png[width="800"]

==== Implementation of `Analysis#analyseCost()`
The actual analysis of costs continues from the the filtering of the filtered transaction list.
This section focuses on the actual computation of the costs incurred by the company.

*Step 1.* In addition to passing the analysis period Predicate, a `PurchaseTransactionPredicate` is
also passed to the filtered transaction list simultaneously. +

This filters the list further, leaving only the `TransactionType.PURCHASE` transactions, which contribute
to the costs of the company. +

Overall, the filtered transaction list will also be updated in the UI.

*Step 2.* `ModelManager` passes control to the `AnalysisManager`.

*Step 3.* In `AnalysisManager`, the helper method `AnalysisManager#calculateTotalCost()` is called
to compute the total costs of the filtered transactions.

It iterates through the filtered transaction list, and checks the `Transaction` 's `TransactionType`
as a precuation. If the `TransactionType` is `PURCHASE`, the `amountMoney` transacted is obtained and
added to a sum of costs. The sum of costs is then wrapped in a `Price` object and returned to the calling function.

// insert diagram!


==== Implementation of `Analysis#analyseRevenue()`
The implementation of the analysis of revenue is similar to that of costs. However, a `SaleTransactionPredicate`
is passed to the filtered transaction list instead.

In *Step 3*, the helper method `AnalysisManager#calculateTotalRevenue()` is called. It iterates
through the filtered transaction list, and checks if the `Transaction` 's `TransactionType` is
`SALE`. If so, the `amountMoney` transacted is added to the sum of revenues. The sum of revenues
is then wrapped in a `Price` object and returned to the calling function.

==== Implementation of `Analysis#analyseProfit()`
The analysis of profit continues from the filtering of the filtered transaction list by period.
This section focuses on the actual computation of the profit earned by the company.

*Step 1.* `ModelManager` passes control to the `AnalysisManager`. No additional filtering is done. +
*Step 2.* In `AnalysisManager`, the helper method `AnalysisManager#calculateTotalProfit()` is called
to compute the total profit of the filtered transactions.

It iterates through the filtered transaction list, and checks the `Transaction` 's `TransactionType`.

* If the `TransactionType` is `PURCHASE`, the `amountMoney` transacted is obtained and added to a sum of costs.
* If the `TransactionType` is `SALE`, the `amountMoney` transacted is obtained and added to a sum of revenues.

*Step 3.* Total profit is calculated using the formula: "profit = revenue - cost".
This total profit value is checked to determine whether it is negative.

* If total profit is positive or zero, it is wrapped in a `Price` object and returned to the calling function.
* If the total profit is negative, the absolute value is taken, and a special `NegativePrice` object is used to wrap the value.
It is then returned to the calling function.
** `NegativePrice` is a sub-class of `Price`, and is used only when calculating profit.
** The `value` of the `NegativePrice` object is the absolute value of the profit.


==== Design Considerations
Aspect: Filtering the transactions by date

* *Current implementation:* Pass predicates to the filtered transaction list, before performing analyses using that list
** Pros:
*** Extensible as more Predicates can be created and passed to the filtered transaction list to filter
the transactions by different facets.
*** Enhances reusability especially of the `updateFilteredTransactionList(Predicate predicate)` method.
*** Allows the transaction list panel in the UI to be updated automatically.

** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each Predicate is correct.

* *Alternative:* Loop through all transactions in the `TransactionList`, and check if the transaction date
is within the desired time period
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have time performance issues if there are many transactions.
// end::analyses[]

//tag::commandPartition[]
=== Command partition

==== Current Implementation

The command partition is an implementation of the role system.

The `model` contain all the
API that is common for every user. `StockTakerModel` contains API for for stockTaker. Similar
idea applied to `AccountantModel` and `ManagerModel`. However, `AdminModel` extends all three models.
As such, `adminModel` will contains all APIs.

.Class diagram for Login related model
image::LoginUMLDiagram/Logic-UML-design-Login.png[width="800"]

After login, `logicManager` will assign a particular role to user according to their
`authenticationLevel`. As such, it will prevent one role from accessing other role's
command.
//end::commandPartition[]

//tag::login[]
=== Login/logout feature

==== Current Implementation

The login feature is a standalone feature that enable security check on user. It has a fxml page that name `LoginPage.fxml` at `main\resources\view`
The controller of the fxml page named `LoginController` at `seedu.address\controller`
The model of is at `loginInfo` which storage the format in JSON with the help of `JsonUtils`.
Also, there is a `loginInfoManager` which include all the API for `loginInfo`.
As such, this is a design that fulfil the Model-View-Controller pattern.

Given below is a class diagram for login function. LoginUtils has attributes of `LoginInfoModel`
 `userName` and `Password`. It also use `passwordUtils` to hashed verify the password with `LoginInfoModel`

.Class diagram for Login related Utils

Given below is an example usage scenario and how login mechanism behave at each step.

image::LoginUMLDiagram/Login_sequence_diagram.png[width="600" height ="400"]
The `LoginController` will check for username and password will the `LoginUtils`.


image::LoginUMLDiagram/LoginUtils_Sequence_Diagram.png[width="600" height ="400"]

=== Save information about user account
Given below is a structure of `Model` components that is related to login feature.
The model stores loginInfo of the user.

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions within the logic components for the execuion of `createAccount` command.


image::LoginUMLDiagram/createAccountSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Given below is an sequence diagram of access login information for `loginInfoList.json` during initiation of the application.
The program also save the the login information to `loginInfoList.json` when `logout` or `exit`.

image::LoginUMLDiagram/Logic-UML-design-ReadLoginInfoList.png[width="800" height ="400"]


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to store the data
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the login detail in a json file called `loginInfoList.json`.
** Pros: Have a systematic and elegant way to store data.
** Cons: Hard to implement
* **Alternative 2:** Store the data in enum.
** Pros: Easy to implement
** Cons: Fixed database. Cannot add /modify/delete accounts. (suitable for very small project)

===== Aspect: Data format for store data

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store in Json file.
** Pros: Json is popular and have many support online.
** Pros :JSON is relatively easier to implement compared to XML
** Cons: Have to write serialized method for JSON file.
* **Alternative 2:** Store in XML file
** Pros: Classic and matured product
** Pros: Have serialized code in original ab4.
** Cons: It has many rules to set before implementation.
//end::login[]

// tag::inventory[]
=== Inventory Management

In Drink I/O, inventory is managed in the model, through the use of Drink Objects with the attributes `name` , `price` , `quantity` , `tags` , `UniqueBatchList` . In Drink I/O, drink purchases are stored in `Batch` objects which are made unique by their `BatchDate` attribute.
These `Batch` objects contain a `BatchId` , a `BatchQuantity` and a `BatchDate` attribute and are stored in the `UniqueBatchList` of the relevant drink.

==== Buying a drink with `buy n/DRINK_NAME q/QUANTITY`
A user may enter a buy command with the above parameters to record a purchase of drinks.

The following is the sequence of steps when the user enters an buy command with specified name and quantity:
Step 1. User enters a buy command (i.e. `buy` `n/Coca cola` `q/400`).

Step 2. The appropriate parser parses the name and quantity parameters and assigns the `name` and `quantity` variables to the `buy` command.

Step 3. The buy command is executed, and a new `Transaction` object is created with the `name` , `quantity` and a `transactionType` variable. This `Transaction` object is then passed to the StockTakerModelManager.

Step 4. In the StockTakerModelManager, `recordTransaction(Transaction)` is used to record the transaction and  `increaseDrinkQuantity(Name, Quantity)` is called to update the change in quantity in the inventory list.

Step 5. The inventory list then passes the `name` and `quantity` variables down to the `UniqueDrinkList` which calls the `increaseQuantity(Quantity)` method in the relevant `Drink` object.

Step 6. In the `Drink` object, a new `Batch` object is created with the `name` and `quantity` variables and passed to the Drink's  `UniqueBatchList` through the `addBatch` method.

Step 7. In the `UniqueBatchList` , the `Batch` that was passed down would be checked against the other `Batch` objects in the list for uniqueness based on its date. If it has a unique date, a new `Batch` would be created and stored in the `UniqueBatchList`, else the currently existing `Batch` object in the `UniqueBatchList` with the same date will have its `Quantity` attribute incremented by the `quantity` value of the `Batch` object added.

Step 8. The `totalQuantity` attribute of the `UniqueBatchList` is then updated by looping through the batches in the list, and is handed up to the `Drink` object which updates its `Quantity` attribute with the value of the `totalQuantity` attribute.

==== Selling a drink

To facilitate sales of drinks from the stock of the company, sales of drinks from the inventory are conducted with the command `sell` `n/DRINK_NAME` `q/QUANTITY`

A user may enter a buy command with the above parameters to record a purchase of drinks.

The following is the sequence of steps when the user enters an buy command with specified name and quantity:

Step 1. User enters a sell command (i.e. `sell` `n/Coca cola` `q/400`).

Step 2. The appropriate parser parses the name and quantity parameters and assigns the `name` and `quantity` variables to the `sell` command.

Step 3. The sell command is executed, and a new `Transaction` object is created with the `name` , `quantity` and a `transactionType` variable. This `Transaction` object is then passed to the StockTakerModelManager.

Step 4. In the StockTakerModelManager, `recordTransaction(Transaction)` is used to record the transaction and  `decreaseQuantity(Name, Quantity)` is called to update the change in quantity in the inventory list.

Step 5. The inventory list then passes the `name` and `quantity` variables down to the `UniqueDrinkList` which calls the `decreaseQuantity(Quantity)` method in the relevant `Drink` object.

Step 6. In the `Drink` object, `updateBatchTransaction(Quantity)` is called and the `quantity` variable is passed down to the `UniqueBatchList`.

Step 7. In the `UniqueBatchList` , `quantity` passed down will be checked against the `totalQuantity` variable. If `quantity` is more than `totalQuantity`, a InsufficientQuantityException will be thrown which would be handled in the `SellDrinkCommand` class. Else, the `updateBatchTransaction` would loop through the `UniqueBatchList` and decrement the quantity of the individual batches starting from the one with the oldest date.

Step 8. The `totalQuantity` attribute of the `UniqueBatchList` is then updated by looping through the batches in the list, and is handed up to the `Drink` object which updates its `Quantity` attribute with the value of the `totalQuantity` attribute.

image::SellCommandSequenceDiagram2.png[width="600"]

==== Design Considerations
Aspect: Facilitating the Buy and Sell Commands

* Current Implementation: Sorting the `UniqueBatchList` by `BatchDate` using a Custom Comparator.
** Pros:
*** Makes implementation of methods such as `addBatch` , `updateBatchTransaction` , `getEarliestBatchDate` , `getOldestBatchDate` much easier as `Batch` objects are already in `date` order.
*** Easy to modify, allowing users to sort batches based on `quantity` by just editing the Custom Comparator.
*** Allows batches shown in the BatchListPanel to be easily ordered based on date.
** Cons:
*** When users replace the Custom Comparator with another comparator, methods such as `getEarliestBatchDate` will have to be edited as they  depend on the `UniqueBatchList` being in date-sorted order.
* Alternative: Loop through all batches in the `UniqueBatchList` for all methods.
** Pros: When the `UniqueBatchList` is sorted differently, methods do not have to be rewritten.
** Cons: May have time performance issues if there are many batches.

// end::inventory[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
